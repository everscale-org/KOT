# KOT

KOT â€“ Kitten Overseeing Trends is a symbol of attentiveness and agility in analyzing and adapting to new trends in the Everscale blockchain. This group of standards can encourage developers and network participants to continuously study and optimize the system, creating a more attractive and efficient blockchain space.

## Creating a new KOT

1. Before submitting a new KOT to Everscale Organization, it is important to discuss it with the community first. For example one way to do this is by participating in chats [Everdev](https://t.me/everdev), [Everscale Smart Contracts](https://t.me/EverscaleSmartContracts), [Everdev Ru](https://t.me/everdevru).
2. Read `KOT-{TODO}` to understand proposal management process.
